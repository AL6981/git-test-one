# Academic Expectations
_Successful completion of Ignition is a prerequisite to joining us during the on-campus experience. Throughout Ignition, you will be expected to make a submission for all “core” challenges contained within the week by their due date. Which challenges are “core”, and their deadlines, will be posted in the #assignments Slack channel on (typically) Monday morning of each week. Challenges are due Sunday night each week._

## Graded Weeks & System Checks
During weeks 3 through 6 of Ignition, the Launch Academy Experience Engineers (EE’s, you can read more about them in the *Ignition Overview* lesson) will review and grade the final coding challenge of the week, called a System Check. System Checks are an opportunity for us to assess your understanding of code, give you feedback, and provide additional ideas and strategies for tackling challenges. So, to give us an accurate view, they must be completed on your own. If you have trouble understanding what a system check is asking for you to do, please send a direct message to an EE during their chat support hours (described below). Once a first/baseline attempt has been submitted, EE’s will be able to provide you with additional feedback and guidance, if desired.

System Checks will receive grades of *“Meets Expectations”*, *“Does not Meet Expectations”*, and *“Exceeds Expectations”*. Expectations are outlined in each challenge, and are based on the skill level students should have at the completion of that Ignition week.

Repeatedly receiving a grade of *does not meet expectations* will have consequences on your academic standing. System checks are the primary way your technical skills will be assessed during Ignition, and therefore the most important prerequisite to coming on campus.


## Missing Submissions & Time away
Failing to submit all of the required challenges by their due date will also have consequences on your academic standing. Launch Academy seeks to prepare you for a career in programming and, as such, we try to mimic what that career will look like. By that guideline, we ask that students treat any time off or missed deadlines as they would in a professional setting: by communicating early and often with their manager (in this case, the Ignition Coordinator). Students should also communicate with the Ignition Coordinator regarding any time off or schedule conflicts they may have for the on campus portion of the program.

When in doubt, overcommunicate - most managers of developers appreciate transparency. Not only that, but the more you communicate, the more we'll be able to guide and assist!


## Submission Privacy
We ask that you refrain from sharing code for System Check assignments in Slack, or on any public code repository (like Github). We use these challenges to assess students, and they should be reflective of your understanding of the problem. All other code may be discussed and shared as you please - we are strong supporters of open source programming at Launch Academy!

If you have any questions about these requirements, feel free to contact the Ignition Coordinator!
